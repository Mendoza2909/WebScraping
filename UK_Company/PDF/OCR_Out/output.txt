Chief Executive Officer’s Report

Pioneer Underwriting Limited (‘the Company’) is the main trading entity within the Pioneer Group.
Pioneer operates a unique underwriting facility model to deliver excellent capacity to our clients and
writes over 25 underwriting facilities, backed by 29 markets. Our continued investment in new
underwriters demonstrates the attractiveness of Pioneer as a dynamic, ﬂexible platform that can offer a

home to entrepreneurial underwriting talent.

2016 was a record year for the Company with income growing by 77% to £22.9m generating a proﬁt
before tax of £7.8m (2015 £1.4m loss). This growth was fuelled by our investment in new teams,
infrastructure and trusted long term partnerships with capacity providers. In 2016 we further
strengthened our management team with a new CUO and CFO whilst continuing to enhance our operating

platform.

Market conditions have remained extremely challenging throughout the course of the year, with declining
insurance and reinsurance rates across many lines however maintaining a disciplined approach to risk
selection and achieving adequate pricing remains our key objective. Looking forward, the Company is
well positioned for 2017 with a well diversiﬁed panel of capacity providers and underwriting teams that
are gaining signiﬁcant traction.

On behalf of the board I would like to thank all of our staff for their signiﬁcant efforts during the year and
to our brokers, clients and capital providers for their continued support.

E Brown served as an executive director until 31 December 2016, whereupon he resumed as a Non-

Directors’ liabilities

The Company has granted an indemnity to all directors against liability in respect of proceedings brought
by third parties, subject to the conditions set out in the Companies Act 2006. Such qualifying third party
indemnity provision remains in force at the date of approving the directors’ report.

Principal risks and uncertainties

The management of the business and the execution of the strategy are subject to a number of risks. The
key business risks and uncertainties affecting the Company are considered to relate to:

competition from managing agents;

the relative value of sterling against our key currencies in which revenues are generated, notably the
US Dollar;

recruitment and retention of staff;

substantial changes in the premium rating environment resulting in a reduction in commission
earnings or increases in premiums reducing the level of demand for the Company’s services; and
claims and claims costs, which can affect the level of proﬁt commission that the Company receives,
(although the underwriting agency operations are not directly responsible for claims).

The business is focused on speciﬁc sectors in which it is believed it can successfully compete. The
reward strategy and development opportunities offered to staff are designed to mitigate the risk of losing
or failing to attract staff.Pioneer Underwriting Limited

Directors’ Report

Audit Information
Each of the directors at the date of approval of this report conﬁrms that:

0 so far as he/ she is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is

unaware; and
o the director has taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a director to make themselves
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of that

information.

This conﬁrmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of
the Companies Act 2006. Deloitte LLP have indicated its willingness to be reappointed for another term
and appropriate arrangements have been put in place for them to be deemed reappointed as auditor in the
absence of an Annual General Meeting.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance

Company law requires the directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law
the directors have elected to prepare the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law).
Under company law the directors must not approve the ﬁnancial statements unless they are satisﬁed that
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the proﬁt or loss of the
Company for that period. In preparing these ﬁnancial statements, the directors are required to:

0 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

o makejudgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;

0 state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the ﬁnancial statements; and

o prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume
that the Company will continue in business.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufﬁcient to show and
explain the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial
position of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements comply with the
Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

We have audited the ﬁnancial statements of Pioneer Underwriting Limited for the year ended 31
December 2016, which comprise the Proﬁt and loss account, the Balance sheet, statement of changes in
equity and the related notes 1 to 18. The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied in their
preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally
Accepted AccOunting Practice).

This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16
of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the

Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor

Asexplained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities, the directors are responsible for

law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with
the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.

Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements

An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements
sufﬁcient to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed;
the reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation
of the ﬁnancial statements. In addition, we read all the ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial information in the

annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited ﬁnancial statements. If we become
aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implication for our

report.

Opinion on ﬁnancial statements

In our opinion the ﬁnancial statements:

0 give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2016 and of the
Company’s proﬁt for the year then ended;

I have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice; and '

0 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

Notes to the accounts
For the year ended 31 December 2016

1. Accounting Policies
The principal accounting policies are summarised below.

General information and basis of accounting

The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with Financial
Reporting Standard 102 (FRS 102) issued by the F inancial Reporting Council.

The functional currency of the Company is considered to be pounds sterling because that is the currency
of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates. The ﬁnancial statements are also
presented in pounds sterling.

Minova Insurance Holdings Limited, the ultimate parent of Pioneer Underwriting Limited, meets the
deﬁnition of a qualifying entity under FRS 102. As a result Minova Insurance Holdings Limited has taken
advantage of the disclosure exemptions available to it in respect of the separate ﬁnancial statements of
Pioneer Underwriting Limited. Exemptions have been taken in relation to share-based payments, share
capital, presentation of a cash ﬂow statement, intra-group transactions and remuneration of key
management personnel, as these additional disclosures not required under previous UK GAAP are not
relevant to the users of the financial statements. ‘

Going concern

The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the going concern basis. After making enquiries, the
directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in

operational existence for the foreseeable future.

Turnover

Turnover represents commissions associated with the placement of insurance contracts net of
commissions payable to other directly involved parties. The Company recognises this income when
earned. Commission is recognised at the later of the policy inception date or when the policy placement
has been completed and conﬁrmed, with a proportion of income deferred over the period of the underlying
contracts to recognise the on-going contractual obligations of maintaining and servicing the contracts over
that period.

Profit Commission

Proﬁt commission is recognised when the amount can be reliably estimated, with a reasonable degree of
certainty.

Foreign currencies

Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at
the rates of exchange prevailing at that date.

Notes to the accounts
For the year ended 31 December 2016

1. Accounting Policies (continued)

Pensions

All employees are eligible to become members of a group pension scheme within three months’ service.
For deﬁned beneﬁt schemes, the Company was unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and
liabilities on a consistent and reliable basis. Consequently, these schemes are treated as deﬁned
contribution schemes and the pension cost charged to the proﬁt and loss account is based on the
actuarially determined contribution rate after each triennial valuation.

For deﬁned contribution schemes, the amount charged to the proﬁt and loss account in respect of pension
costs and other post-retirement beneﬁts is the contributions payable in the year. Differences between
contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or
prepayments in the balance sheet.

_ Other long-term employee beneﬁts are measured at the present value of the beneﬁt obligation at the
reporting date.

Taxation

Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or
recovered) using the tax rules and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance
sheet date.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the
balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or
a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing differences are
differences between the Company’s taxable proﬁts and its results as stated in the ﬁnancial statements that
arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which
they are recognised in the ﬁnancial statements.

Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that, on the basis of
all available evidence, it-can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable proﬁts
from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.

Where items recognised in other comprehensive income or equity are chargeable to or deductible for tax
purposes, the resulting current or deferred tax expense or income is presented in the same component of
comprehensive income or equity as the transaction or other event that resulted in the tax expense or

income.

Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the
amounts and the Group intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability
simultaneously.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if: a) the Company has a legally enforceable right to set
off current tax assets against current tax liabilities; and b) the deferred tax assets and deferred tax
liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or
different taxable entities which intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to
realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which signiﬁcant
amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered. ~

12~ Pioneer Underwriting Limited
m

Notes to the accounts
For the year ended 31 December 2016

Share-based payment

The Group issues equity and cash settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled
share-based payments are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non market-based vesting
conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-
based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate
of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.

The fair value is expensed over the vesting period, subject to revaluation at the end of each year. Any
changes in the fair value are recognised in the proﬁt and loss account.

The directors use a valuation model based upon an historical ﬁve year earnings per share multiple to
measure the fair value of a share.

2. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

In the application of the Company’s accounting policies, which are described in note I, the directors are
required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are
based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may
differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the
revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects
both current and future periods.

Critical judgements in applying the Company’s accounting policies

The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (which are dealt with
separately below), that the directors have made in the process of applying the Company’s accounting
policies and that have the most signiﬁcant effect on the amounts recognised in the ﬁnancial statements.

Proﬁt commission

Proﬁt commissions are a type of contingent commission whereby the commission paid from the risk
carrier or underwriter (typically the insurer) to the broker or managing general agent, depending on the
deﬁned profitability calculation of a speciﬁc book of business over a ﬁxed period of time.

Profit commission is recognised when the amount can be reliably estimated, with a reasonable degree of
certainty.

3. Geographical analysis of turnover by source

2016 201 5
£000 £000
United Kingdom 22,948 12,962

 

The business activities of the Company are primarily based in the United Kingdom, and this is where the
Company’s operating proﬁts are generated and its net assets are held. The turnover arises from the

Company’s principal activity.
